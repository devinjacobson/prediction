It uses the GPML toolbox 3.0 corresponding to the book "Gaussian Processes for
Machine Learning" by C.E. Rasmussen and C.K.I. Williams. The toolbox is
available at http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code but has been included
here for convenience.

In addition, the software depends on the GNU Scientific Library
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl) and on the Boost C++ libraries
(http://www.boost.org); these have not been included but need to be installed
before this software can be built successfully.

Further, one of the experiments needs GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org/)
installed, a LaTeX distribution, and the 'gv' PostScript viewer.

The software has been developed and tested under Ubuntu 8.04.


License
=======

This software is licensed under the FreeBSD license (also known as Simplified
BSD license). See the file COPYING for the exact license terms under which this
software is distributed.


Installation instructions
=========================

1. Install the GNU Scientific Library packages
(for example, on Ubuntu this can be done by the command
"sudo aptitude install libgsl0-dev")

2. Install the Boost C++ libraries
(for example, on Ubuntu this can be done by the command
"sudo aptitude install libboost-dev")

3. Build the MEX files for GPML for more performance
(see gpml-matlab-v3.0-2010-07-23/README for details)

4. Edit the Makefile to adapt it to the local configuration
(for example, specify whether you want to use MatLab or Octave)

5. Build the software using "make"


Usage instructions
==================

Run all experiments by issuing "experiments" from MatLab or Octave.
