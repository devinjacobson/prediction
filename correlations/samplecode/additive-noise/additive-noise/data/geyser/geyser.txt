This data is also available in R: package MASS, as 'geyser'. It might be
wise to leave out the durations which are exactly 4, exactly 3, and exactly
2 as these were originally measured only as L, M, S (for some reason they
could not measure these in seconds during night-time).



In R, type:
	library('MASS')
	geyser
then copy/paste to a file 'geyser.tmp1'

In bash, type:
	awk 'print $2,$3' geyser.tmp1 > geyser.tmp2

The first column is w_t, the time interval between the starts of
successive eruptions, the second is d_t, the duration of the
subsequent eruption. 

Then, type:
	python geyser.py < geyser.tmp2 > geyser.dat

This outputs three columns to geyser.dat, containing
only precise data, in the form

d_t i_t d_{t+1}

So causally, we can only have that col 1 causes 2 (and maybe 3)
and col 2 causes col 3.
