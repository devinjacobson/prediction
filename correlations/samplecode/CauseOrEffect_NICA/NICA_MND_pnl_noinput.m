function [y, net, SNR, fx1, fx2] = NICA_MND_pnl(x,s)
% Use of "Nonlinear ICA with MND for Matlab" for distinguishing cause from effect 
% Version 1.0, Aug. 15 2007
% PURPOSE:
%       Performing nonlinear ICA with the minimal nonlinear distortion or
%           smoothness regularization.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% INPUTS:
%       x (n*T): a matrix containing multivariate observed data. Each row of the 
%           matrix x is a observed signal.
%   OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       s (n*T): contains the original independent sources. If it is
%       provided, the SNR will be evaluated; otherwise SNR is empty.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OUTPUTS:
%       y (n*T): the separation result.
%       net: the structure specifying the separation MLP network. It
%           contains all weights and biase.
%       SNR (1*2n): The sigal-to-noise ratio of y, as well as that of
%           \tau(y) w.r.t. the original indepdnent sources.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% USAGE:
%       [y, net, SNR] = NICA_MND(x,s); or
%       [y, net, SNR] = NICA_MND(x);
