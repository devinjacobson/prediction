The design of this library combines the world of Object-Oriented
and Procedural programming. Many of the basic functions to do
stuff to data are handled in procedures. Complex algorithms that
carry a lot of state are bundled up in classes. Data and functions 
that can be categorized generally falls into objects.

While not the prettiest library in the world, it is leaps and 
bounds ahead of what we started with.
