It uses the LBFGSB MatLab wrapper by Peter Carbonetto, and the Fortran77 LBFGSB
code written by Ciyou Zhu in collaboration with R.H. Byrd, P. Lu-Chen and J.
Nocedal. This code has been included here for convenience. This code can be found
in the lbfgsb/ subdirectory.

It also uses the LBFGSB-related wrappers of the GPML toolbox 3.1. The toolbox is
available at http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code but part of it has been included
here for convenience. This code can be found in the gpml-util/ subdirectory.

In addition, the software depends on the GNU Scientific Library
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl) and on the Boost C++ libraries
(http://www.boost.org); these have not been included but need to be installed
before this software can be built successfully.

Installation instructions
=========================

1. Install the GNU Scientific Library packages
(for example, on Ubuntu this can be done by the command
"sudo aptitude install libgsl0-dev")

2. Install the Boost C++ libraries
(for example, on Ubuntu this can be done by the command
"sudo aptitude install libboost-dev")

3. Build the fasthsic MEX file
(change the supplied to reflect the local system configuration,
and run "make" from within the fasthsic directory)

3. Build the LBFGSB wrapper supplied with the GPML library
(see gpml-matlab-v3.0-2010-07-23/README for details)


Usage instructions
==================

Run the experiments in the paper by issuing "run_experiments" from MatLab or Octave.
