This package contains code to the paper
Peters, J., D. Janzing, A. Gretton and B. Schölkopf: Detecting the Direction of Causal Time Series. Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2009), 801-808. (Eds.) Danyluk, A., L. Bottou, M. L. Littman, ACM Press, New York, NY, USA

Parts are written in Matlab and parts in R, which is not very convenient, but it should work on any machine (although it might be necessary to adapt the code for non-linux users).

IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The R function
    arima_sim.R
simulates from an ARMA (or ARIMA) model and stores the time series in files on the hard drive.
    arima_fit.R
reads time series data from txt or R files (e.g. the simulated data from arima_sim.R) and fits an ARMA (or ARIMA) model to the data. The coefficients and the residuals are saved in files on the hard drive.




The Matlab function
    identify_timedir_example.m
loads time series data from txt files (or R files). It outputs visualizations of the matrix classified_matrix, which contains the proportion of cases, where the method tries to give a result, and of the matrix cor_classified_matrix, which contains the proportion of correct answers (out of the classified ones). Both depend on alpha and delta (see paper). 
    identify_timedir.m
takes as input either 
The vector res contains the results:
 1: The method infers the correct time direction,
-1: the method infers the wrong time direction,
 0: the method does decide because the difference in p values is too small,
 2: the method does decide because the model does not fit in any direction,
 3: the method does decide because the residuals seem to be normal.
