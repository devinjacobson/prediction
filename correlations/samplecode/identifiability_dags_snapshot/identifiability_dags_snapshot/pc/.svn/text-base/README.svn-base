The main function
    function g = pc(X,cond_ind_test,pars,maxFanIn,alpha)
applies the PC algorithm (including Meek's Rule) to the data matrix X. See pc.m for details.


EXAMPLE:
% generate data from the model
%      1   2
%    /  \ /
%   3 -> 4
% PC recovers the true Markov Equivalence Class
% (arrows pointing downwards)
